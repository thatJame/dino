## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This device was first built by an 11 year old in just two hours. After making some modifications we came up with this design.

The program is designed to be simple and easy to use. Depending on device brightness you will need to change variables to detect whether or not it detects a cactus. 

The program **only works on light mode**, but you can probably make it run on dark mode by changing the operator and light level detected.

## 2. Device Design <a name="Materials"></a>

This device was designed to be as simple as possible. To build it you will need the following:

 - Arduino Uno
 - Breadboard
 - 180° Servo Motor
 - Photoresistor
 - 220Ω resistor

## 3. Device Design <a name="device"></a>

The original design used [Inventr Hero boards](https://inventr.io/products/hero-board-usb-cable). You can find the modified device design for [Arduino Uno](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3) (and similar devices) below:

## 4. Experimental Features <a name="experimental"></a>

This entire project is experimental for the time being, so all updates will add any experimental features we've been working on.

## 5. Demos <a name="demos"></a>
